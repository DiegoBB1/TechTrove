 GETTING STARTED: 
 This website is still in the development phases and is not being hosted yet.
 For testing and development purposes running in a local server is preferred for now.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 HOW TO HOST LOCALLY:
 There are many ways to host the website locally, for this setup we will use XAMMP and APACHE 
 to create a local server to host the website on. First ensure you have XAMPP downloaded and 
 this can be accomplished by downloading the necessary download at https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
 where you can select a download for Windows, Linux, or Mac operating systems.
 After downloading run the installer and download required packages and any extra packages you wish.
 Once this is done you can then run the XAMPP controller and start your APACHE web server and MySQL
 database. (NOTE: AT this point if you already have MySQL downloaded you may recieve an error when 
 attempting to start MySQL in XAMPP. To fix this you must change the default MySQL port for more
 information on how to do this follow this link: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-change-the-port-of-a-MySQL-server-in-XAMPP)
 Once this is completed and both APACHE and MySQL are running you are ready to run the website locally.
 Navigate to where you are storing the downloaded files including
